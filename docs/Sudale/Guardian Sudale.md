The Champion of Sudale is a being of whimsy and caprice, a trickster at heart who delights in the fluidity of size as
both a concept and a reality. Unlike the solemn guardians of other moons, Sudale's protector embraces a more
lighthearted approach to their dominion, often altering the scale of objects and creatures for sheer amusement or to
teach a lesson in perspective. This playful deity views their world as a canvas for endless creativity, where size is a
tool for both jest and enlightenment.
