## Galaine: The Azure Expanse and Its Capital

Nestled amidst the endless blues of Galaine's oceanic vastness lies its largest landmass, the crown of a slumbering
giant. This dormant volcano, a relic from a world before the cataclysm, rises majestically from the depths, its colossal
crater cradling a bay that serves as the heart of the moon's capital. Around this tranquil bay, the capital sprawls in
harmonious chaos, with houses crafted from the wood of the sparse forests that dot the landscape, echoing the
adaptability and resilience of Galaine's people.

## The Capital: A Harmony of Land and Sea

The capital, a testament to the moon's spirit, wraps around the bay like a necklace of jewels, its wooden structures a
defiance against the ocean's claim. The largest landmass provides not just a foundation for the capital but a symbol of
Galaine's identity: a world where land and sea, though in eternal contest, exist in a delicate balance. The volcanic
crater, now a serene lagoon, serves as both a natural harbor and a sacred space, reflecting the Guardian's connection to
both the land she protects and the seas that cradle her realm.

## Culture and Connection

The culture of Galaine is deeply intertwined with the sea, and its capital is no exception. Here, the stories of the
deep are woven into the fabric of daily life, and the Guardian is revered not just as a protector but as a living
embodiment of Galaine's past, present, and future. Her form, that of a mermaid, serves as a constant reminder of the
adaptability and resilience required to thrive in this world, inspiring her people to maintain a respectful and
symbiotic relationship with the ocean's vast mysteries.
