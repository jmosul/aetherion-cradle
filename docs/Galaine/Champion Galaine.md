        Galaine's Guardian, a being of profound beauty and power, watches over her realm with a grace that belies the strength
        beneath. With skin the color of the clearest summer sky and features as delicate and refined as the elves of legend, she
        embodies the moon's essenceâ€”a bridge between the ethereal and the earthly. This Guardian prefers the grandeur of her
        aquatic domain, spending days gliding through the vast ocean or basking in the sunlit waters of the lagoon within the
        volcano's heart.
