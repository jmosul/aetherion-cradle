**The Pilgrimage: A Journey of Valor and Wisdom**

Pilgrims drawn to Alynne find themselves immersed in a society where their trials span the gamut of combat, strategy,
and the pursuit of knowledge. The moon’s diverse landscapes serve as the arenas for their trials, from the arid expanses
that test their endurance to the lush forests that challenge their stealth and wisdom. In earning the Champion’s
blessing, they embody the moon’s ethos of strength tempered with intellect, ready to carry these virtues across the
Cradle.
