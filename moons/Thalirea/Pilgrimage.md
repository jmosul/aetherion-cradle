Pilgrims to Thalirea embark on a journey that is less about traversing distances and more about navigating the depths of
understanding. The pilgrimage here is a test of one's ability to see beyond the visible, to uncover truths hidden in
darkness, and to embrace the profound quietude that shadow offers. The Championâ€™s blessing to these travelers is the
wisdom to understand the balance between light and dark and the ability to find one's path in the absence of light.
